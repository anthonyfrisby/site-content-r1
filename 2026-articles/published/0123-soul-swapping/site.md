I’ve decided to refer to dead people as is, not was.

I realised I already do it with my brother.

I never use was to refer to him, I always use is.

It’s because truly someone is only ever inside you, you never experience the person outside of you.

And especially when someone dies, then they do truly exist inside of you.

And so they still exist.

Just in you.

I heard this saying somewhere:

*when you know or love someone you swap a bit of your soul with them. So when they die, a bit of your soul dies, that’s why it’s so painful, but their soul lives with you forever and they experience the things that you see through you, because they’re inside you.*

So take them with you on your journey. Show them the things that you know they want to see. Express them through yourself.
