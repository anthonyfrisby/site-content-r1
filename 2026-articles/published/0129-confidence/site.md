I love this idea of thinking about confidence rather than as something which you attribute to yourself due to some success that you have achieve, rather, it being a role that you step into.

Quite often the idea about confidence is that you are confident because of things that you've done, wins that you've achieved, something that you have attributed to yourself, or something that you feel because of some kind of external qualification process.

For sure, those things certainly do give you confidence. But that state of confidence is a temporary structure, out of your control. 

Perhaps confidence can be more like a role that you step into. For example, if you're in the role of a mother or a father, then you have the confidence to run into a burning building to save your offspring. 

And if you believe that you are in that role, in that current position and situation, then you have the confidence that goes along with that role.

So I guess the question then is, how can you use that idea? And I suppose the answer is you can create roles that give you confidence.
